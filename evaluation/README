This folder includes the tools and python script files used for the evaluation.
Due to the wide range of different tests and test setups, the
.py files contain only loosely connected functions.
Some files, such as deploy_and_test.py, needed to be specifically customized on 
each sender to fit certain constraints, such as network interfaces, MAC or 
IP addresses. Other files need to be customized for the individual test runs.
Thus, these files are not supposed to be runnable out-of-the-box.
Furthermore, some functions rely on the external libraries Scapy and Numpy.
It is also assumed that tcpreplay is installed on the sending machine as well as
the tools found in the "sources" dir. Use "make" to compile the tools.

The tools include: 

Unified Packet Filter		-		Tool for Rule Set Transformation
db_generator						-		ClassBench Rule Set Generator
trace_generator					-		ClassBench Header Trace Generator

Files used in all Tests:

cb_generate.py
save_state.py

Files used for Processing Time and Rule Set Size:

proctime_rulesets.py

Files used for the Simulation: 

simulate_rulesets.py
simulate_combined.py
UPF_Simulator.py
packet_func.py

Files used for the Jump Tests:

deploy_and_test.py
test_jumpsets.py

Files used for the Packet Throughput Tests:

deploy_and_test.py
test_rulesets.py

Files used for Validation of Transformation Correctness:

log_sender.py
log_receiver.py

Files used for the Combining Optimizations test:

simulate_combined.py
ipfw_table_count.py
test_rulesets.py

Files used for processing the results of the tests:

plotting.py
